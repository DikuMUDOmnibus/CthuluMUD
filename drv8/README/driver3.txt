CthulhuMud Driver 3
-------------------
   Specials (special.c)
     Extended teleTracker and TeleHunter to behave differently for flying
       Mobs.  They won't go inside and print fly messages rather than 
       teleport messages.

   XP hiding (act_info.c, fight.c, act_comm.c)
     Score - Blurred xps to next level(few/some/lots) , hid total xps.
     Report - Removed xp total.
     Worth - removed xp total and xps to next level.
     Group - removed xp column.
     Fighting - Blurred xps gained (none/few/some/lots).
              - Flee loss dropped to 5, removed from message.
     Gods can still see xps through stat.

   Show command (act_info.c, interp.c, interp.h)
     Shows selected object to all other characters in the room.

   Examine command (act_info.c)
     Now shows:
       Long description
       All extra descriptions matching the first name word
       Attribues (invis, glowing, humming, auras etc...)
       Condition
     Shared subroutine with show. 
     Preparation for skill filtering of the extra descriptions.
     Improved message for containers and corpses.

   Look command (act_info.c)
     Will show all extra_descriptions matching the keyword, not
       just the first one.
     Preparation for skill filtering of the extra descriptions.
     
   STAT hiding (statdesc.h, act_info.c, comm.c)
     Stats shown as VLow/Low/Poor/Average/Good/High/VHigh.
     Same for initial roll.
     Stats on initial roll now include class and race bonuses. 
     Stat roll changed from 5d4 to:
           Prime stat: 13 + 2d4  15 / 18   / 21
           Int & Wis :  8 + 3d4  11 / 15.5 / 20
           Other     :  4 + 4d4   8 / 14   / 20
       - Should get a playable character.
       - Prime stat used to always be +2. 
       - Race modifiers included, but only PC race is human.
       - Might help cut down on the number of rerolls.
       - The masking helps quite a lot as well.
     Gods can still see stats through stat.

   Practice (update.c, act_info.c)
     Number of practices gained determine by average is WIS and the
       classes prime stat.  This means you can be a warrior with average
       WIS and high STR and get 3 practices rather than 2.
     Skill gain from practice determined by average of INT and the
       classes primary stat.  This means you can be a warrior with
       average INT and high STR get +7% per practice rather than +5%.
       The value is also fuzzed by +/- 1 (25%/50%/25%).   
     The top of the skill gain table has also be made more linear.
       Maximum gain ((INT+xxx)/2 = 25) is now 17%. It was 21%.
       The effect is only noticable when (INT+xxx)/2 is over 22.
     Hopefully these changes will pull the average practices per level
       towards 3 or 4, and the averge gain per practice towards 7 or 8%. 
       It will help the stupid and foolish, while not hurting the cleaver
       and wise.

   OLC (old_act.c)
     Modified ed to handle multiple keyword descriptions.
       The add subcommand takes all following words as keywords.
       Added a change subcommand to change keywords for a description.
       Room editor now shows them delimited like the object editor does. 
       Changes for both the room and objects versions of the ed command.
     Modified sector so it also sets the inside and dark flags.
       Sector underground -> inside, dark
       Sector inside      -> inside, light
       Sector xxxx        -> outside, light
 
   Mobs (db.c, merc.h, bit.c)
     Added an ACT_RAND_KIT flag.  The mob will only get random equipment
       if it is set.

   Spells (magic.c, magic.h, db.c, const.c)
     Added a 'create_potion' spell that makes a random potion.

   Look/Examine (act_info.c)
     Objects now show their condition if it isn't perfect.
     Characters do so as well.
     Objects show if they are closed. 

   Terrain (const.c, merc.h, bit.c, act_move.c)
     Added Swamp, Moor and Space.
     Added Misty room attribute (stops scan).
     Added hostile sector types:
        space      - 3d4 drowning damage, 4d6 cold damage
        underwater - 3d4 drowning damage 
        small fire - 3d4 fire damage
        fire       - 5d6 fire damage
        big fire   - 7d8 fire damage 
        cold       - 4d6 cold damage 
        acid       - 2d6 acid damage 
        lightning  - 8d10 lightning damage, chance = level
        holy       - 5d10 holy damage, scaled by alignment
        evil       - 5d10 negative damage, scaled by alignment
     Added Environment pulse, so fires once every 10 seconds.

   Guns (const.c, db.c, merc.h, fight.c, bit.c, handler.c, act_obj.c
         act_info.c)
     Added two kills - gun and handgun
     Added three weapon types - WEAPON_GUN, WEAPON_HANDGUN & WEAPON_SMG
     Added new damage type - DAM_SHOT
     Added immunity - IMM_BULLETS, RES_BULLETS, VULN_BULLETS
     Added new weapon damage type - shot
     Added new mob damage type - shot
     Guns go BANG! (when they work)
     Guns go Click! (when empty)
     Guns are silent (when jammed)
     Guns can have 1, 2, 6, 12, 36 or 108 shots
     Removing and rewield/dualing a gun reloads it and clears any jams
     Dual guns (probably handguns - guns and smgs should be 2 handed) work 

   Locker support (locker.c, merc.h, act_info.c, act_move.c, db.c, db2.c
                   act_obj.c, handler.c, magic.c, bit.c, olc_act.c)
     Added locker.c to save and restore lockers.
     Added ITEM_LOCKER, ITEM_LOCKER_KEY and ITEM_CLAN_LOCKER.
     You need a locker key to open any locker (they are pick proof).
     Unlimited capacity.
     Lockers are saved to disk once every 60 seconds when open.
       - only open lockers saved
       - save uses temp file, just in case...
     Personal lockers use file '../player/name.locker.gz'
     Clan lockers use file '../player/clan.n.locker.gz'
     Mechanism to ensure that the same locker is only open in one place.
       - big consistency problems if this is done otherwise.

   Banks (bank.c, merc.h, wiz_act.c, act_obj.c, db.c)
     Bank commands available everywhere.
       - Only work in a room with a bank taller.
     Bank teller is a shop_keeper with no buy items.
     Commands are balance, deposit and withdraw.
     Interest is 0.1%, calculated daily (3%/month, 42%/year).
     Complete bank data saved after every transaction.
     Bank data stored in file /clan/banks.txt.
     Accounts with 0 gold are not saved.

   Area Locking (merc.h, bit.c)
     Set via OLE
     Disables:
       - teleporting into the area
       - portals to someone in the area
       - Non IMMORTALS walking into them
     Note that this is saved in the area file 
       - Save after setting it
       - Save after clearing it
     This lets us keep development areas locked to avoid nasty teleport 
       accidents.  

   Recovery (update.c)
     Fix recvery of hits and mana
       - Result rounded up on the divide by 6.
     Double rate of mana recovery.
       - So mages won't have to wait around on full hits and half mana
         for as long.
     Neutralize the effct of Haste on mana recovery
       - It used to halve it.

   Player Divinity (update.c, db.c, act_info.c, act_magic.c, save.c)
     3 Player levels - Newbie, Regular and Hero
     5 God levels - Creator, Lesser, God, Greater, Implementor
     Assoreted macros defined.
     Loaded as value for Divinity
     Shows on Stat and Score
     Used for some checks
     Automatically set when the player is loaded
     Player levels updated with level gain/loss
     Changed the trust command to change the god levels dynamically
       - Trust now seems to be unused.
     Raise limits on level advancement (now set to MAX_LEVEL)
 
   Mythos Races (const.c)
     Deep-one
     Snake person
     Mi-go
     Ghoul
     Ghast
     Shambler

   Miscellaneous (comm.c, bit.c, act_info.c, interp.c)
     Added a 'Please enter your name:' prompt to the login sequence.
       It always appears, regardless of what happens to the greeting.
     Fixed a few on the constants imbedded in bit.c
     Changed thresholds for armour descriptions.  
       This means AC 0 now says your armour is ok.
     Fixed wizhelp format, reformatted for divinities.
     Changed clans to write out via temporary file and rename.
       - Better recovery charicteristics.
     Flags for FreeBSD compilation.
     Added a message board for immortals.
     Fixed bug where link dead characters were not being extracted
       properly.  This caused a mud crash whenever someone else tried
       to enter or leave the room.
     Fixed the weather so that people other than gods get to see it.
       The AH had it on NOTIFY_WEATHER, but it was off by default and
       the notify command is level 56, so noone could turn it on!  
     Initialise each characters learned array to 0s.
     Practice colour coded.
       - normal is grey, adept (65%) is cyan, mastered (100%) is white.
     Found (and maybe fixed) a strange bug concerned with skills and
       page_to_char.  What's strange is that the fix seemed to take a 
       while (a few compiles) to have any effect.  I was still working
       on it and the problem just went away. It might have been part of
       the system having gotten messed up by a unchecked string free
       in page_to_char (might have been freeing string at address 0).
