	Added fixed bank.c from Yog.

	Changed all vnums to be of type VNUM in preparation for library support.

		VNUM is just a long at the moment, which will eventually be split into a 2 byte
		library code and a 2 byte vnum (as in the standard rom vnum).

		xxx_data->vnum, recall, dream, respawn, morgue, day, night, exit keys

		Object values change to long so they can still hold a full vnum.
		
		No increase in runtime as a g++ int is 4 bytes, same as a g++ long.

	Makefile
	db.c
	olc_save.c
	music.c

	Integrated with Yogs code from May 25th.

	Fixed Makefile to include music.o into the merc executable and to add music.o as a 
	makeable entity.

	Fixed bug with music.c trying to fclose the music file if it failed to open it.

	Fixed P reset - P 0 obj_vnum count cont_vnum

		Will now search the room (from last O or M reset) and all mobs in it for all
		objects with the vnums indicated by its 3rd parm.  The specified number of
		objects will be placed within that object.  This will happen even if a player
		or a mob is carrying the object.

		Through OLC you can only create a P reset for an object inside an object in
		the room.  I guess you could give the same object to a mob and then delete the
		reset in the room.

		The object should be created before the P reset is executed or the obects will
		be missing until the second reset.

        Fixed R reset - R 0 room_vnum dir_count 0

		Will now muddle up the exits up to the dir_count minus 1.

			 4 - NSEW
			 6 - NSEWUD
			10 - NSEWUD plus NSEW diagonals
			12 - NSEWUD, diagonals plus In and Out

		The resets command displays R resets ok, but there doesn't seem to be any way
		to create R resets through OLC.

	merc.h
	bit.c
	act_obj.c
	db2.c
	wev.h
	wev.c
	triggers.c
	magic.c
	handler.c

	Added ROM extra identification flags:

		ROM_NONMETAL
		ROM_NOLOCATE
		ROM_MELT_DROP
		ROM_HAD_TIMER
		ROM_SELL_EXTRACT
		ROM_BURN_PROOF
		ROM_NOUNCURSE

		There is no code behind these, they are just for translation.

		Due to limitations on the extra_flag numbers NONMETAL, HAD_TIMER and BURN_PROOF
		are not being implemented within Cthulhumud. 

	Added extra flag: ITEM_MELT_DROP
	Added wev subtype: WEV_DROP, WEV_DROP_ITEM_MELT

		An item with this flag dissolves into smoke if it is dropped.

	Added extra_flag: ITEM_NOLOCATE

		An item with this flag set cannot be found with a locate object spell.

	Added extra_flag: ITEM_SELL_EXTRACT

		When an item with this flag is sold, it is removed from the game (like trash).

	Added extra_flag: ITEM_NOUNCURSE

		If an item with NODROP or NOREMOVE has this set, the 'curse' cannot be removed by
		the 'remove curse' spell.
