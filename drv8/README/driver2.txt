CthulhuMud Driver 2
-------------------

  Aliases
    Fixed problem with parms 6 theu 9
    Reworked alias/parm scanning to be more efficient.

  Makefile
    Fixed so it has all the .h dependencies.

  Specials
    Added spec_hunter
      This causes a mob to remember who it is fighting and then to attack
      them the next time it sees them.  The prey field introduced will
      also be used by the tracking routines. 
    Added spec_teleTracker
      This causes a mob, once its prey has been set, to teleport into
      whichever room the prey is in.
    Added spec_teleHunter
      A combination of Hunter and TeleTracker.  The mob will teleport into
      the room and, about 3 seconds later, attack their prey.  This gives 
      the prey a small chance to run away (but they have to keep running!).
    Added spec_hound
      This is an extension of spec_teleHunter.  If the mob does not have
      any prey, it will go to room 30000 and commit suicide. 

  Gods
    Changed admins to Marduk, Nodens, Dagon
    Changed lots of Zatans to Marduks

  Races
    Removed Azer
    Added highlander
    Renamed Centaurs to Scorpionmen
    Only player race is human 

  Stats
    Changed WIS bonuses to be a little higher
    
  Classes
    Rename the standard classes
      Mage -> Occultist
      Avenger -> Priest
      Thief -> Archaeologist
      Soldier -> Warrior
      Chaosmage and Defiler unchanged

  Levels and Equipment
    Modified checks to allow usage of equipment of up to level+10
      Wield/wear code 
      Buy code
      Dual code (bug in current code alows any level weapon in off hand)
      Potions 
      Portals
    Disabled recall if level > 10

  Player killer
    Added seperate flag
    Update whois information 

  Anti-trigger
    Added traps for Search, Pick and Quaff 
      system.are file added to hold related items.
      Quaff
        2 in 1 second means you spill the second potion
      Search
        2 in 1 second gives 1% cumulative chance of finding a Hound
               of Tindalos in a dark corner.  It will appear and kill
               you.  If you run it will teleport after you and kill you.
      Pick
        2 in 1 second gives a 1% cumulative change of being transported
               into the 'Halls of Doors'.  This is a large maze of
               some 15 no-recall rooms.  All links have locked doors.
               There's an exit in one of the rooms, food and water in
               another.  No mobs. 

  Miscellaneous
    Changed welcome message to say CthulhuMud
    Allowed summon in a few more situations
    Disable the spam detection code
    Cthonified the spells a bit

  Oddities
    We have a declare for spell_summon_minion, but no code.
