<h3>
<b>Scribe [Skill]</b></h3>

<p><br>The scribe command allows a mage to attempt to create scrolls of
various spells.&nbsp; Scribing a spell requires several things.&nbsp; First,
the spell must be known to the mage, and it must be a spell that is allowed
to be scribed. There is a monetary cost, a mana cost, and component requirements
for scribing spells.&nbsp; First, you must have sheets of vellum, each
spell requires a fresh sheet.&nbsp; Depending on the particular spell,
there may also be a second material component required, but this will be
a rare occurence.
<br>Scrolls will eventually dry up and crumble to dust if not used.<b></b>
