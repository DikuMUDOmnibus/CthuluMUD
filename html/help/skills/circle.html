<h3>
<b>Circle [Skill]</b></h3>

<p><br>Circle is a skill learned by advanced thieves, murderers, and other
rogues. It can be used with any weapon type, but is most effective with
piercing weapons. This skill allows the practicer to slip out of sight
of his opponent briefly, and launch a surprise attack upon him from behind.
Needless to say this is very difficult to accomplish, and thus it only
thieves ever learn this skill.
<br>Circle only works when the victim is either blind or is not focusing
directly on you in combat.&nbsp; Fighting in a group is an excellent way
to get circle attacks to work effectively.<b></b>
