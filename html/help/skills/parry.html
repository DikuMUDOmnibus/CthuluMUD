<h3>
<b>Parry [Skill]</b></h3>

<p><br>If at first you fail to dodge, block it.&nbsp; Parry is useful for
deflecting attacks, and is successful more often than dodge.&nbsp; Parry
requires a weapon for full success, the hand-to-hand skill may also be
used, but results in reduced damage instead of no damage.&nbsp; The best
chance of parrying occurs when the defender is skilled in both his and
his opponent's weapon type.
