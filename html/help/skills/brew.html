<h3>
<b>Brew [Skill]</b></h3>

<p><br>The brew command allows clerics to attempt to create potions.&nbsp;
Brewing a potion of a specific spell requires several things.&nbsp; First,
the spell must be known by the cleric, and it must be a spell that is allowed
to be brewed.&nbsp; Generally, most non-offensive spells are brewable.&nbsp;
There is a monetary cost, a mana cost, and component requirements for brewing
as well.&nbsp; Specifics vary from spell to spell.&nbsp; Some components
are harder to find than others.
<br>Potions do not last forever, they will evaporate eventually.<b></b>
