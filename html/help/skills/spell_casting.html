<h3>
<b>Spell Casting [Skill]</b></h3>

<p><br>Before you can cast a spell, you have to practice it.&nbsp; The
more you practice, the higher chance you have of success when casting.&nbsp;
Casting spells costs mana. The mana cost decreases as your level increases.
<br>The &lt;target> is optional.&nbsp; Many spells which need targets will
use an appropriate default target, especially during combat.
<br>If the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the spell
name.
<p>Example: cast 'cure critic' frag.&nbsp; Quoting is optional for single-word
spells.
<p>When you cast an offensive spell, the victim usually gets a saving throw.The
effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes the saving
throw successfully.
<p>See also the help sections for individual spells.
<p><b>Syntax: cast '&lt;spell>' [&lt;target>]</b>
