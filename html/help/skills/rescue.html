<h3>
<b>Rescue [Skill]</b></h3>

<p><br>A friend in need is a friend indeed.&nbsp; And when in combat, a
warrior with the rescue skill is just the friend you need.&nbsp; Rescue
allows you to intercede in combat, protecting weaker characters from bodily
harm. Hopefully the favor will be returned.&nbsp; Success in rescuing depends
on the skill rating, as well as a comparison of level, dexterity, and speed
between the character and the target. (note: you rescue a friend, not the
monster)<b></b>
