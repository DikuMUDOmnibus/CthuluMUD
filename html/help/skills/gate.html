<h3>
<b>Gate [Spell]</b></h3>

<p><br>The gate spell is a powerful transportation magic that opens up
a portal between your character and another person or creature somewhere
else in the world.&nbsp; This portal will transport you and any pet you
might have, but not other members of your group.&nbsp; Monsters recieve
a save against gate, and monster or players more than 3 levels higher than
you can not be gated to at all.&nbsp; God rooms, private rooms, and no
recall rooms cannot be gated to, and no recall rooms cannot be gated out
of.&nbsp; Finally, any god or hero is also immune to gate, as well as is
player who has nosummon set.
