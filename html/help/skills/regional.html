<b>Arkham / Innsmouth / Yuggoth / Ulthar / Dreamlands [Skill]</b></h3>

<p><br>These skills represent the amount of knowledge you have earned about
a region in the Realm. These are the three main cities where players begin
their lives, and they determine professions which can be used and differentiate
whether you come from the Dreamlands, or the real world.
