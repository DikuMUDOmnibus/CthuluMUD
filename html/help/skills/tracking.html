<h3>
<b>Tracking [Skill]</b></h3>

<p><br>By observing their environment carefully, a skilled adventurer can
learn to detect minute details about who has been there recently. They
will be able to tell who has been around, and which way they went.
<br>However, this skill can only be used in natural areas, as concrete
streets leave little evidence to follow.
