<h3>
<b>True Dreaming / Rude Awakening / Recurring Dream / Enchanted Sleep [Spell]</b></h3>

<p><br>Pulling the target fully into their dream, <b>true dreaming</b>
causes the caster to see their dreams as reality, and their former 'real
world' becomes a thing of dreams..
<br><b>Rude awakening</b> sends a dreaming player abruptly back into their
reality.
<br>Casting the <b>recurring dream</b> spell sends an awakened player back
to the last point they were dreaming from.
<br><b>Enchanted sleep</b> evokes a deep sleep on the target, deeper than
the Sleep spell. This sleep is so strong, in fact, that the target will
immediatly be sent into the dream world. Normally, nightmares don't happen
whith this spell.
