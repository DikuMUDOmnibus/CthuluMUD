<h3>
<b>Chaos [Spell]</b></h3>

<p><br>Chaos is a spell available to those who delve into the chaotic magics.
Actually, it is more a rather simple spell to execute, but hard to protect
from. Once the caster unleashes this spell, he has opened a channel to
the pure magic forces from another plane which simple rip through him,
and tear through everything in the room, doing damage.
<br>Chaos does damage in a multitude of ways, since the magics from other
planes are very unpredictable.
