<h3>
<b>Shield / Stone Skin / Iron Skin [Spell]</b></h3>

<p><br>These are all spells which summon strength from within the caster,
providing mystical protection and lowering (improving) the caster's armor
class. The better you are at the spell and the higher your level, the greater
the protection.
<br>The shield spell summons a shield of energy which surrounds the caster,
absorbing some of the incoming damage and reducing injury.
<br>Stone skin is a spell which weaves fibers of the very rock into the
caster's skin, making it far harder to slice or bruise them and greatly
reducing damage taken. Iron skin is a similiar, but more powerful spell.<b></b>
