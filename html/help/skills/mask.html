<h3>
<b>Mask Self / Incognito [Spell]</b></h3>

<p><br>This spell gives you nearly the full appearance of the target mob.&nbsp;
Anyone casually walking into the room you occupy, or scanning from a distance
will not be able to distinguish you from a mob.&nbsp; Looking directly
at you will still reveal your real equipment (if you're not superior in
that spell), so the masking isn't perfect.
<br>However, it is very good for avoiding detection.
<br>If you cast Incognito, the victim to mask as does not need to be in
your room.<b></b>
<p><b>Syntax:</b>
<br><b>cast 'mask self' &lt;character></b>
<br><b>cast 'incognito' &lt;character></b>
