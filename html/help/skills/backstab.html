<h3>
<b>Backstab / Assassinate / Blackjack</b></h3>

<p><br>Backstab is the favored attack of&nbsp; thieves, murderers, and
other rogues.&nbsp; It can be used with any weapon type, but is most effective
with piercing weapons. The damage inflicted by a backstab is determined
by the attacker's level, his weapon skill, his backstab skill, and the
power of his opponent.
<p>Assassinate is the master skill of silent &amp; fast killing.&nbsp;
It will give you a huge advantage on your first attack - even more, when
you're using a gun type weapon (sniping rifles prefered).
<p>Blackjack is a fast way to knock an enemy out with the first blow.&nbsp;
It's extremely powerful but only does stun damage.
