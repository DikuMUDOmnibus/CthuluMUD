<h3>
<b>Languages [Skill]</b></h3>

<p><br>For those willing to learn, there are many languages which can be
used to communicate in the Realm. Learning new languages will allow you
to speak to others who talk that language, and will allow you to understand
what they say in return. The better you are at a language, the easier it
becomes to communicate.
<br>Languages which can be learned, so far, include: English, Spanish,
French, German, Gaelic, Polish, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Hebrew, Arabic,
Greek, Latin, Heiroglypics, Old English, Romany, Stygian, Atlantean, and
Cthonic.
<br>Some of these, of course, are long dead tongues used by civilizations
long wiped out... It becomes far harder to find a teacher for such languages.
