<h3>
<b>Debating [Skill]</b></h3>

<p><br>With that skill you can begin a discussion about any other academic
skill (no dabating about dodge or dual wield!).&nbsp; Such a discussion
will take some time and might tire you down, but if you succees, there
is a chance you can learn something about the skill you were talking about.&nbsp;
If you lose the debate, you might feel a bit unsure about what you really
know of that skill.
<br>Not everyone is able or willing to debate.
<br>Not everyone can understand your language.
<br>You'll gain most, if you try to debate with someone, who is almost
as good in debate as you are.
