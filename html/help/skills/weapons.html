<h3>
<b>Weapon Skills [Skill]</b></h3>

<p><br>Each weapon skill applies to a specific group of armaments, and
determines how well a character fights with a particular weapon.&nbsp;
If the character has the parry skill as well, he can parry incoming attacks.&nbsp;
The chance of parrying is best if the character in question is skilled
at both his weapon and his opponent's.
<br>The weapon skills consist of the following:
