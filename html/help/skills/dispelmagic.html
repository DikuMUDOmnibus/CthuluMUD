<h3>
<b>Dispel Magic [Spell]</b></h3>

<p><br>Both of these spells remove magical effects from the target.&nbsp;
Dispel magic has a reduced chance of working, and is considering an attack
spell.
<br>Cancellation can only be used on allies, but is much more effective
and does not provoke attack.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the spells do not discriminate
between harmful and benign spells.
<br>The chance of dispelling is based on the level of the spell. Permanent
spells (such as mobile sanctuary) are much harder to remove.&nbsp; Not
all spells may be dispelled, notable examples are poison and plague.
<br>Note:&nbsp; Cancellation does not require a verbal incantation, so
it can be cast even when the caster is mute.
<p><b>Syntax:</b>
