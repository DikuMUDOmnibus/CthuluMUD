<h3>
<b>Shield Block [Skill]</b></h3>

<p><br>Shield block is a rather fancy name for the art of parrying with
a shield. Characters with no shield block skill will not be able to defend
themselves well with a shield.&nbsp; All classes may learn shield block,
but only warriors and clerics are good at it.&nbsp; Beware, flails ignore
shield blocking attempts, and whips have an easier time getting around
them.&nbsp; Axes may split shields in two.
