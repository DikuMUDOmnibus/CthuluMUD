<h3>
<b>Combat Magic [Spell]</b></h3>

<p><br>These are the powerful spells with which mages attack their opponents.
The higher level the spell, the more damage it causes, but also the longer
and harder it is to cast.
<p>In using acid blast, the caster summons a ball of powerful acid and
fires it at the victim, causing severe acid burns and powerful damage.
<p>Casting burning hands causes the caster's hands to light aflame for
several seconds. While on fire, the caster presses his or her hands against
the victim's flesh, causing burning damage.
<p>When casting colour spray, a mage fires blasts of colour from their
fingertips, dazzling the enemy, and causing damage with the speed and power
of the colourful particles.
<p>The spell fireball is just as it seems, wherin the caster summons an
enormous ball of flames and launches it at the victim, with both the impact
of the ball and the intense heat causing powerful amounts of damage.
<p>Using the lightning bolt spell causes the mage to fire bursts of electricity
from their outstretched fingers, similar in power to a strike of nature's
furious lightning.
<p>Shocking grasp combines the basics of burning hands and lightning, causing
the caster's hands to become electrified and deliver a powerful shock to
the victim when grabbed and held.
<p>Casting magic missile releases a volley of purple missiles, formed of
energy which impact the target, causing damage.
<br>Zap is a smaller version of magic missile, firing only one, relatively
weak missle at the target. It is, however, far easier to cast than magic
missle, making it a good starting spell for newer players.
<br>The magic zapper spell is a stronger, more powerful version of magic
missle, firing as many missiles, with each one at twice the intensity.
It does great deals of damage, but is harder to cast.
