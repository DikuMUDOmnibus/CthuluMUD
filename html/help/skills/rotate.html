<h3>
<b>Rotate [Skill]</b></h3>

<p><br>The rotate skill allows a character to change his focus of attack
from one creature to another.&nbsp; The victim *must* already be fighting
you in order to change your focus to him/her.&nbsp; The ability to reposition
yourself this way in a fight is based on several factors.&nbsp; Your dexterity,
your level in relation to the mob you're trying to stop focusing on, and
your skill % for rotate all play a big part in determining whether you
can successfully rotate to another mob.<b></b>
