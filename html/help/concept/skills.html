<h3>
Skills</h3>
Each player has a number of different skills. Each skill is related to
a specific area of ability and reflects the players knowledge and competence
in that area.
<h4>
Skill Ranks</h4>
Skills are ranked on a numerical scale, with 0 meaning no skill whatsoever
and 100 meaning mastery. Ratings beyond 100 are possible, reflecting those
who elevate the skill to an art form.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The skill ranks are:
<ul>
<li>
<b>Hopeless</b> - No skill</li>

<li>
<b>Dabbler</b> - Marginal skill, &lt; 20</li>

<li>
<b>Novice</b> - A little skill, &lt; 40</li>

<li>
<b>Student</b> - Some skill, &lt; 60</li>

<li>
<b>Adept</b> - Adequate skill, &lt; 80</li>

<li>
<b>Master Adept</b> - Considerable skill, &lt; 100</li>

<li>
<b>Master</b> - Master of the skill, &lt; 120</li>

<li>
<b>Grand Master</b> - Great mastery of the skill, &lt; 150</li>

<li>
<b>Exemplar</b> - Someone who has perfected the skill, > 149</li>
</ul>
Once you learn a skill beyond the Student level it becomes progressively
harder to improve your skill. This is a part of the reason that Exemplars
are so rare.
<h4>
Advancing Skills</h4>
You can advance skills through either <a href="pracntrain.html">practice</a>
or usage. With practice you can find an adept teacher and use the
<a href="../comm/practice.html">practice</a>
command to learn. He is able to teach you any skill within your
<a href="../concepts/profession.html">profession</a>
up to Adept level.
<p>You can also use the <a href="../comm/learn.html">learn</a> command
to learn a skill from a teacher. Some NPCs are capable of teaching skills,
as are some PCs. If you acquire the <a href="../comm/teach.html">teach</a>
skill you will be able to teach other players skills.
<p>The final way to improve your skill is simply through usage. The more
you use it, the more likely you are to gain new insights into the skill
and increase your ability.
<h4>
Understanding Skill Usage</h4>
When a skill check needs to be made, an <a href="opend100.html">open ended
d100</a> is rolled and the appropriate skill is added. The result is compared
to either a fixed target or a skill roll made by your opponent. This means
that the chances of success depend upon your skill, the die roll and, if
you have one, your opponents skill.
<p>A skill of 100+ does not guarentee success and a skill of 0 does not
guarentee failure. Under this system a fight between two people with attack
and parry skills of 150 is the same as between people with only 50 in those
skills.
