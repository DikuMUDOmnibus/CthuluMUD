CthulhuMud Rules</h3>

<p><br>This are the rules of CthulhuMUD.&nbsp; For other matters, use commom

<p>1) Player killing {Ris{x allowed. Type "help pkill" for details. Do
not kill without good reason and never ever attack newbies.
<p>2) Foul and/or abusive language will not be tolerated on CthulhuMud,
from anyone (including gods). Punishments range from deletion to NOCHANNELing.
<p>3) Sexual harassment of any form will not be tolerated, punishable by

with other characters you own -- by any arrangment.
<p>4) No kill stealing.&nbsp; This means you cannot attack a mob someone
else is fighting, unless they ask you to. If a mob is injured, and you
are not the one who injured it, you may not under any circumsances attack&nbsp;&nbsp;
it.This means NO. Whether it is an easy mob or a hard mob or there is not
even anybody else logged in! A flag makes spotting of injured mobs easier.
<p>5) Cheating will not be tolerated.&nbsp; This includes accepting favors
from gods and exploiting bugs. If you find a bug, report it, then do not
use it.
