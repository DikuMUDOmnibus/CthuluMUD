<h3>
Cthulhu</h3>

<p><br>Cthulhu is a god who figures very largely in Lovecraft's Cthulhu
mythos. This tentacle-faced denizen of the sea lies sleeping in R'Lyeh
where he waits for the time when his followers will release him from his
chains so he can rule the world once more.&nbsp; He is an evil god who
is bent on the destruction of the human race, despite this fact he does
have a large number of followers who do actively try to release him using
such books as the Necronomicon.
