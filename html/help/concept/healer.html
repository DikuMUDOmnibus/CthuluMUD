<h3>
Healer / Alienist</h3>
There are persons, who offer help to the sick and the wounded. But they
won't do that for free - in fact they know for sure, you're direly in need
of help. If your're at a healer the <b>heal command</b> gives you a list
of all kinds of healing offered.

<p>In case you have been at places mortals shouldn't be and seen things
mortals shouldn't see, you'll need some very different kind of therapy.
Watch your behavior and if you begin doing things, you didn't intend to
do, it's time to see the alienist. The <b>therapy command</b> will show
you his price list, there.
