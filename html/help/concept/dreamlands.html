<P>The dreamlands are a reality beyond our own, where we go when we reach 
a deep dream state.
Although everyone can get there, it takes some skill, and those who
practice will find that they are able to return there more easily and
may have more control over the environment when they are dreaming.</P>
<P>Skills and abilities gained while dreaming are retained, however some
items may not be.</P>
<P>One interesting point to note is that the natives of dreamlands consider
themselves to be in the waking world and that our relaity is a dream world.
A dream world they sometimes visit in thier dreams!</P>
