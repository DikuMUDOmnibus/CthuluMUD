<h3>
Lockers</h3>
You'll soon be carrrying around more stuff than you can hold - and everything
seems quite important to you. What to do now?
<br>Get yourself a locker, where you can put erverything you don't need
right now but maybe sometime later. You'll find lockers close to every
starting point and you'll only have to do a simple little quest to get
one.
