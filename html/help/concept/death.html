<h3>
Death</h3>
When your character dies, you find yourself back at your permanent respawn
point. Your corpse is being trasported to the closest morgue together with
all of your equipment. Your gold stays with you. Any spells which were
affecting you are canceled by death. Following and groups are not affected
by death.
<p>You lose experience points for dying.&nbsp; Under level 25, you lose
half-way&nbsp; back to the beginning of your level, thus dieing over and
over won't hurt too much. After level 25, though you lose 500 xp per death.
If this takes you to a lower xp level, then you lose that level. If you
got a Permadeath flag set on you, your death will result in deletion.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Corpses decay after time, and the objects inside corpses decay with
them. Player corpses last *roughly* 30 hours of game time (15 minutes of
real time).&nbsp; Only the player who died, or someone in the same group,
can retrieve objects from a player's corpse.
