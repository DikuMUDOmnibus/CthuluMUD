<H3>Open d100</H3>
<P>This is a way of rolling a 100 sided dice to produce a random number.
The computer actually uses a pseudo-random number generator (PRN), but the
effect is the same.</P>
<P>A 100 sided dice produces a number between 1 and 100.
The open part of the roll adds the following rules:</P>
<UL>
<LI>If the roll is greater than 95, roll again and add the result.
<LI>If the roll is less than 5, roll again and subtract the result.
</UL>
<P>These rules are applied recursively, so very high and very low rolls
are possible (but unlikely).</P>
<P>There is about a 1 in 20 chance of rolling unusually high and an
equal chance of rolling unusually low.
A second roll in either direction occurs about 1 roll in 400, and a 
third about 1 in 8000.</P>
