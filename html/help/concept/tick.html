<h3>
<b>Tick</b></h3>

<p><br>Many of the game actions are based upon interval timers, including
combat, most autonomous monster actions, hp/mana/move regeneration, spell
duration, weather, and area resetting.
<br>Of these timers, the hp/mana/move regeneration timer is popularly called
the 'tick'.&nbsp; Ticks on this mud average 30 seconds of real time, but
the actual amount varies randomly from 15 seconds to 45 seconds.
<br>Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if no one is in the
area; less often (15 minutes) if some one is.&nbsp; Also note that objects
lying on the ground will not be regenerated if anyone is in the area when
it resets.
