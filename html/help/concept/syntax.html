<H3>Command Syntax</H3>
<P>The representation of the syntax for the commands follow these rules:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Keywords are in <B>bold</B>
<LI>Variables are in normal type
<LI>Optional parameters are in [square brackets]
<LI>When there are mutliple forms of the command, they are listed on
separate lines
<LI>Where a parameter is shown enclosed in single quotes it must be entered
as such unless it is only a single word.
</OL>
<H4>Examples</H4>
<PRE>
  <B>quests</B> [<B>all</B>]
</PRE>
<P>This means you can issue <B>quests</B> or <B>quests all</B>.
<PRE>
  <B>cast</B> 'spell name' [target]
</PRE>
<P>This means that you must specify the name of the spell, say armor,
and you may specify a target (say Bubba).
If you do not specify an optional parameter, what happens depends upon the
command and the context.</P>
<P>The above would let you issue <B>cast 'armor' bubba</B> 
(which would cast the spell upon Bubba) or
<B>cast 'armor'</B> (which would cast the spell upon yourself).</P>
<P>Note that the quotes are not required here, as the spell name is 
a single word.  
While <B>cast armor</B> would work, <B>cast word of recall</B> would not.</P>
<PRE>
  <B>bank balance</B>
  <B>bank deposit</B> gold
  <B>bank withdraw</B> gold
</PRE>
<P>This describes three varients of the bank command used to check your
bank balance (<B>bank balance</B>) to deposit gold coins into the bank
(<B>bank deposit 100</B>) and to withdraw money from the bank
(<B>bank withdraw 50</B>).</P>
