<h3>
Player Killing (PK, PKill)</h3>

<p><br>That means not only to attack mobs but also other players. We're
a full PK MUD - but that doesn't mean you can kill anyone you want to.
If there are IN-PLAY reasons or even a clan war, PK is good and
<br>justified - if it's just for fun, it's strictly forbidden. Even more
if low level characters are being attacked. If ever, there should be too
much unjustified killing, we can and we will switch to <b>PERMADEATH</b>
without further notice. Permadeath means that if you pk, during the mud
is set permadeath, you get a flag that causes your <b>DELETION</b> the
next time you get yourself killed.
<br>So choose wisely whom to attack!
