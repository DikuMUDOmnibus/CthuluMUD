<h3>
Practice and Training</h3>
A character has both practice sessions and training sessions. Practice
sessions can be used to improve the characters skills, while Training sessions
can be used to improve thier attributes. A character will typically gain
3 practice sessions and one training session each time they gain a level.
<h4>
Practice</h4>
To practice a <a href="skills.html">skill</a> you need one or more practice
sessions and a suitable teacher. This can be an adept mob, a mob with the
teaching skill or another character with the teaching skill.
<ul>
<li>

<li>
<a href="../comm/learn.html">learn</a></li>

<li>

One you have passed the <a href="skills.html">adept rank</a> in a skill,
it becomes harder to improve it through practice.
