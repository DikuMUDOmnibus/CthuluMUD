<h3>
Bugs</h3>

<p><br>A bug is anything in the game that the immortals have deemed a mistake
in the code, areas, rules, or layouts. Immortal comment is FINAL on saying
whether or not something is a bug. If an immortal tells you something you
are doing is a bug, you may not argue that it is not. Continuing to exploit
a bug after being warned WILL result in deletion. Just because you are
able to do it does not make it legal.
<br>.
