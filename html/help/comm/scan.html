<h3>
<b>Scan / Exits</b></h3>

<p><br>Exit: Tells you the visible exits of the room you are in.&nbsp;
Not all exits are visible. You can't use the 'bump' technique to find hidden
exits. Searching might reveal a hidden exit, but some use levers, buttons,
switches to open them. <b>Autoexit</b> manages the use of that command
for you.
<p>Scan: In addition to the features, exit command offers, scan looks for
mobs in the surrounding rooms. As long as it's not dark of foggy, it is
able to report, who's there.
