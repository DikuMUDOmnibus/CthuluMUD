<b>Teach</b></h3>

<p><br>If you have the teaching skill, this lets you teacha skill to another
player who is following you.&nbsp; Count is the number of practice sessions
they are going to use to learn the skill from you.&nbsp; Teach works best
when you effectiuve skill (the skill being taught multiplied by your teaching
skill/100) is greater than your pupils skill.
<p>Note that a cash transaction will occur, with the pupil paying you for
your teaching.&nbsp; If you wish a different price, you should negotiate
it separatly before hand.
