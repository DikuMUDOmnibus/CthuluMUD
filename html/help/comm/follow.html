<h3>
<b>Follow / Group</b></h3>

<p><br><b>FOLLOW</b> starts you following another character.&nbsp; To stop
following anyone else, just FOLLOW &lt;yourself>.
<br><b>GROUP</b> makes someone who is following you a member of your group.
Group members share experience points from kills and may use the <b><a href="http://cthulhu.mud.at/help/comm/say.html">GTELL</a></b>
and <b>SPLIT</b> commands.&nbsp; If anyone in your group is attacked, you
will automatically join the fight, if your <b><a href="http://cthulhu.mud.at/help/comm/auto.html">AUTOASSIST</a></b>
setting is ON.
<p>If the character is already a member of your group, then GROUP will
kick out the character from your group.&nbsp; Characters can also leave
your group by using a FOLLOW command to stop following you.
<br>GROUP with no argument shows statistics for each character in your
group.
<br>You may FOLLOW and GROUP only with characters who are within five levels
of your own.
