<P>The practice command lets you review your current skills and improve
those skils if an adept teacher is present.</P>
<H4>Syntax:</H4>
<PRE>
  <B>practice</B>
  <B>practice</B> 'skill' [count]
</PRE>
<P>Without a parameter it shows all skills you have and any 
<A HREF="../concepts/profession.html">profession</A> skills
that are available for you to practice.
It also shows you how many total skill points you have and how many
practice sessions you have available.</P>
<P>When a skill is specified it will try and increase your score
in the skill.
The amount you gain is determined by many factors, including your
intelligence and your current skill level.
To practice a skill you must have one practice session and you must
be in the presence of an adept mob.
An adept mob is one who is set up to let you practice your skills.</P>
<P>If you specify a count, it will use that many practice sessions on the
skill, gaining a corresponding increase in your score with the skill.
This can be beneficial, as your initial score is used to determine the
difficulty and sometimes using 2 or 4 practice sessions will squeeze an
extra point out of the rounding process.</P>
<P>Typically a practice session will give you 7-9 points in a skill,
although some skills are easier to learn than others.</P>
