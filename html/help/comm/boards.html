<h3>
<b>Boards</b></h3>

<p><br>These commands are used for the new note system. Instead of just
one board, there are several, each with its special purpose.
<br>Changing between the boards is accomplished using the <b>board</b>
command. Board without any arguments gives you a list of all boards together
with number ofunread message. To change, type board &lt;number> or board
&lt;name of the board>.
<p>To read next unread note, type <b>note</b>. To read a note with a specified
number, type note read &lt;number>. Typing note while in a board with no
unread notes shifts you to the next board. Note that unlike the standard
note system, a note has the same number in note list and note read.
<p>Posting a message is as simple as writing note write. You will be moved
into interactive mode, where all you see are prompts for the fields like
To:, From: etc. You will be automatically put AFK while writing a note.
<p>To see the list of the notes in the current board, type note list. Typing
note list &lt;number> will list only &lt;number> of the last notes in the
area.
<br>You can remove your own note by using note remove &lt;number>. Implementors
may remove other people's notes. Implementors can also select how many
days their note is kept before being purged. Purging happens automatically
at bootup. Purged notes are not deleted, but saved into a file.
<p>To let only immortals see your note, address it to "imm". To let players
of a specific level and above, address it to that level (no other recipients
may appear in that case).
