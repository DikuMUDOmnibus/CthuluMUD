<h3>
<b>Learn</b></h3>
<b></b>
<p><br>You can try to LEARN too, if you find a friendly mob with a considerable
TEACH skill. Skills you can learn from such a mob can be shown with learn
&lt;mob>. Only try to learn from capable teachers and only skills they
got at 50% or more. Else it could be waste of practice sessions. There
are teachers, who ask money for their services.
<br>Teach is a skill, you can't learn.
<p><b>Syntax: learn &lt;teacher> &lt;skill></b>
