<h3>
<b>Quit</b></h3>
<b></b>
<p><br>SAVE saves your character and object.&nbsp; The game saves your
character every 15 minutes regardless, and is the preferred method of saving.&nbsp;
Typing save
<br>will block all other command for about 20 seconds, so use it sparingly.
<br>(90+ players all typing save every 30 seconds just generated too much
lag)
<br>QUIT leaves the game.&nbsp; You may QUIT anywhere. When you re-enter
the game you will be back in the same room.
<br>QUIT automatically does a SAVE, so you can safely leave the game with
just one command.
<br>If you don't intend to come back, please DELETE instead of quitting.
<p><b>Syntax: quit</b>
