<h3>
<b>Deed / Quest</b></h3>

<p><br>These are commands to see your quest status and to learn, if yor've
already done some important things. Deed brag allows you to inform others
about private deeds so everyone else can see them too.
<br>Unlike other MUDs we got more than enough quests and so we do not need
to jealously forbid to tell anyone how to finish a quest. Feel free to
help newbies and give them suggestions if they play well.
<br>But don't forget it's more fun for them, if they succeed on their own.
<p><b>Syntax:</b>
