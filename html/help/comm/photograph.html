<h3>
<b>Photograph</b></h3>

<p><br>If you have a camera, containing a photographic plate, you can take
photographs. This will take some seconds and record all evends during that
phase.
<br>A smarter way is to wait for a certain event. This is done by triggered
photography - you specify a certain event to trigger the photo. Then everything
during the next few seconds (including the trigger event) is being recorded.
