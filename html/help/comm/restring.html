<b>Restring</b></h3>

<p><br>Every shop offers restring for the objects it'd buy too - so you
might have to look around a bit, which shop restrings which object.&nbsp;
There are 3 types of restring and normally it makes senes to change all
three.
<p>name => Keyword list for the object
<br>short => short name, inventory name
<br>long => the ind of text that is shown in room description
<p>Every restring action costs 10000 gold.
