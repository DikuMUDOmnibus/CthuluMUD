<h3>
<b>Therapy</b></h3>

<p><br>In this dark, demonic realm, you will occasionally encounter something
that is not fit for mortal eyes to see, and that mortal minds cannot cope
with. Eviscerated, mangled corpses, beings which are beyond the realm of
understanding.. Whenever you see such a thing, and the fear in your heart
bursts forth, it will slowly chip away at your sanity leaving you a wreck
of a being, mentally inept. The only way to undo it is to find a therapist,
one who can help you work through your problems. When you find one, type
<b>therapy</b> to see what kinds of therapy you can receive.
