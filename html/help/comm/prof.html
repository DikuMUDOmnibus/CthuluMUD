<b>Professions</b></h3>

<p><br>This command allows you to display all of the defined professions
and details about each one.&nbsp; It shows the skills available at each
level of that profession as well as some numbers concerning new characters
created in that profession.
<br>You can also use it to change your profession.&nbsp; This costs 3 practice
points and can only be done once you have reached 3rd level in your current
profession.&nbsp; When you change to a new profession you gain a beginners
rank in all of it's base (level 0) skills (unless you already have a higher
score in them).
