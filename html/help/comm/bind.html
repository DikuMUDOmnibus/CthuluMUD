<h3>
<b>Bind / Free / Rob / Carry</b></h3>

<p><br>By turning off the <b>autokill</b> switch, and removing your weapons,
you will attempt to knock your opponent out instead of killing them. Once
this is accomplished, if you're wielding a bondage object, you can <b>bind</b>
that player. They will be unable to move, speak, or do anything else. While
in this state, of course, they are very vulnerable, and can be carried
around, or robbed of any object in their inventory. Remember that to some
this action could be construed to be as bad as pk, so bind consciously,
and with RP reasons only. And remember that bound players cannot eat or
drink, so be kind and free them when you're done, else they may starve
or die of thirst, or be easily killed by a passer-by.
<br>Remember, just like with PK, everything must have an RP reason or it
will be dealt with.
