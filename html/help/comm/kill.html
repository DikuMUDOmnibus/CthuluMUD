<h3>
<b>Kill</b></h3>

<p><br>The kill command is used to initiate combat with a mob. You should
only attack what you know or what you've <b>consider</b>ed to see if you
can handle it, otherwise be careful. Kill is not the only way to start
a fight. Using offensive spells or skills can hinder the opponent as well
as starting the battle, which is sometimes a great help. Try your skills
and spells out to see what works best.
