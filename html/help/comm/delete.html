<h3>
Delete - Command</h3>

<p><br>Use the delete command to erase unwanted characters, so the name
will be available for use.&nbsp; This command must be typed twice to delete
a character, and you cannot be forced to delete.&nbsp; Typing delete with
an argument will return your character to 'safe' status if you change your
mind after the first delete.
<br>Please delete, if you're sure, you'll never play this character again.
<br>Newbies will be automatically deleted, if they are not played for the
duration of a month.
