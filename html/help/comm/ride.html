<h3>
Ride</h3>

<p><br>It's possible to ride several types of animals as much as bikes.&nbsp;
Both are handled as charmed pets but vehicles stay where they are when
not ridden and don't participate in combat.&nbsp; While riding, you can't
enter underground or inside areas, but you save lots of movement points.
