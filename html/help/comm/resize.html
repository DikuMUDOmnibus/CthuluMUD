<h3>
<b>Resize / Repair</b></h3>

<p><br>Resizing and repairing of objects can be done by any shopkeeper
who normally would buy such objects from you.&nbsp; The greater the size
difference between the object and you, the higher the cost of resizing.
<br>Repairing costs are based on how badly damaged an item is.&nbsp; Using
the "cost" option with either command simply asks the shopkeeper for the
servicing cost without actually performing any action on the object.<b></b>
