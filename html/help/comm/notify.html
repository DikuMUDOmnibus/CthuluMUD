<h3>
<b>Notify</b></h3>

<p><br>The notify system was written to provide players with a customizable
method of seeing various events happening on the mud.&nbsp; Many events
are broadcast over the notify system:
<br>player logins, player quits, player lost links, player deaths, player
leveling, player deleting, clan joining, clan acceptance, clan promotions,
clan quitting, clan declaring war and peace.
<p>Notify messages can be sent to all players or sometimes just members
of a specific clan, as such, setting clan related events ON or OFF may
or may not have a noticable effect.
<br>Using the notification system is simple.&nbsp; Typing 'notify' by itself
will show the status of all your notify channel events.&nbsp; Typing'notify
&lt;event>' will toggle that event ON or OFF.&nbsp; If you want to turn
all the events ON, just type 'notify all'.&nbsp; Similarly, to turn all
events OFF, just type 'notify none'.
