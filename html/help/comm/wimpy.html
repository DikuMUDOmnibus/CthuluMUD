<h3>
<b>Wimpy</b></h3>

<p><br>WIMPY sets your wimpy value.&nbsp; When your character takes damage
that reduces your hit points below your wimpy value, you will automatically
attempt to flee.
<br>You will only flee if your character is not in a wait state -- i.e.
has not been using combat commands like cast, trip and bash, and has not
been tripped or bash by an enemy.
<br>If a direction is specified, this is the first direction you will try
to run in.
<br>If the room has no exit in that direction, another one will be chosen
at random.
<br>Specifying a direction of 'none' or 'random' causes you to flee in
a random direction.
<p>WIMPY with no argument sets your wimpy value to 20% of your maximum
hit points. Some monsters are wimpy.<b></b>
