<h3>
<b>Brainsuck</b></h3>

<p><br>Migo, as a race, eat the brains of other races to further their
own intelligence and power. Brainsucking another player will decrease their
intelligence, and increase that of the migo. Of course, you cannot suck
the&nbsp; brain of a struggling target. In order to suck someone's brain,
first you must knock them out and maybe even bind them. A player can only
have their brain sucked once. The amount of intelligence gained by the
migo is entirely dependant on level. Newbies cannot be brainsucked, and
sucking the brain of someone 10 levels below you will provide no gain whatsoever.
