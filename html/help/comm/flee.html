<h3>
<b>Flee</b></h3>

<p><br>Once you start a fight, you can't just walk away from it.&nbsp;
If the fight is not going well, you can attempt to FLEE (you can also RECALL,
but this is less likely to work, and costs more experience points, then
fleeing). If you lose your link during a fight, then your character will
keep fighting, and will attempt to RECALL from time to time.&nbsp; Your
chances of making the recall are reduced, and you will lose much more experience.
<br>Wimpy setting will automatize fleeing, when you reached a certain Hitpoints
treshold.
