<h3>
<b>Recall</b></h3>
<b></b>
<p><br>Recall takes you back to a safe location somewhere in your area.&nbsp;
Most of the time it will be rather central and close to a fountain and
some shops.
<br>But don't hope, RECALL will take you to your starting point all the
time. If you want into some strange area, it won't take you out, but simply
send you to a safe sopt in that area.&nbsp; Recall costs half of your movement
points and if you do it in combat, you'll get an additional experience
panalty. Furthermore there are certain romms, you can't recall from.<b></b>
