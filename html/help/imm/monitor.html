<p>Monitoring is the ability for a mob in one room to observe all <a href="events.html">events</a>
of a certain type that occur within another room. A mob may monitor multiple
rooms.
<p>This gives you the ability to, effectively, create room progs, where
performing a certain action in an otherwise empty room will cause something
to happen. The 'animation' here is being provided by the off screen mob
who is monitoring the room where the action occurs. Such mobs may often
be called Maxwell.

<h2>
Establishing Monitors</h2>
Monitors are a part of a mobs definition and are added through the OLC
Monitor command.
<br>When a mob is created its monitors are established, when it is destroyed
its monitors are removed.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
Global Monitors</h2>
There is a room, monitoring everything that happens in the mud. By default
room 20 is used for this purpose. Always be careful, placing mobs there
or modifying triggers on them.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
Establishing Anchors</h2>
As well as mobs can monitor rooms, objects can do the same. But since they
have no use for the events (remember, no triggers!) all they can do is
distribute the event to ehere they are, availiable to everyone in room.
Still working with anchors is rather flexible: You can anchor the obj to
a room, to a mob or another object.
