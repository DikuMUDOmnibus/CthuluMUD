CthulhuMud - Mob Commands</h1></center>

<p>Mob Commands are a set of commands that are provided to allow <a href="character.html">non-player
mobiles</a> to perform actions that would either be impossible for normal
players or which affect the game state rather than the world state.
<p>Mob Commands are normally coded in scripts and use substitution parameters
to obtain details of victims from the <a href="events.html">event</a> that
triggered the script. When extracting targets from an event, it is better
to use the victims true name (@_t) than its first name (@_1). This is because
the true name uniquely identifies the mob, while the first name may match
mobs other than the correct target.

<h2>
Mob Commands - Details</h2>

<h3>
<a NAME="mpalign"></a>MPALIGN victim target_alignment</h3>
The victims alignment is changed to bring it closer to the target alignement.
The amount of the change is equal to 10% of the difference between the
victims alignment and the target alignment.
<br>This is typically used to 'reward' good or bad actions that would not
otherwise affect the players alignment.
<h3>
<a NAME="mpanswer"></a>MPANSWER victim question</h3>
<font size=+0>The mob initializes an ELIZA chat based on the given question
and directed towards to victim.</font>
<h3>
<a NAME="mpartifact"></a>MPARTIFACT artifact/ALL</h3>
The mob starts reporting about the whereabouts of a certain specified artifact
or all artifacts in the game. Be careful with the ALL option.
<h3>
<a NAME="mpat"></a>MPAT vnum command</h3>
This causes the mob to silently move into the room corresponding to the
vnum, issue the command (whatever it is) and the return to the room it
was in when the MPAT command was issued. No messages are created.
<p>This command is useful to having a mob in one location cause things
to happen in other locations, providing the effect of animated objects
or for situations where the mob is not in the same room as the victims.
<br>The room that someone is in can be extracted from an event with the
@_r token, although the information has a short self life, as the player
may move to a different room.
<p><a NAME="mpchat"></a><b><font size=+1>MPCHAT</font></b>
<p>A mob command for manipulating chat states.
<br>Without any parms it causes the mob to undergo a normal chat check.
<br>With a parameter, a single number, it directly updates the mobs chat
state.
<h3>
<a NAME="mpconv"></a>MPCONV victim conv_id sub_id new_state</h3>
This lets the mobile directly set one of the victims conversational state.
The can allow new conversational possabilities in view of something that
the player has seen or done.
<h3>
<a NAME="mpdeed_add"></a>MPDEED victim ADD id type title</h3>
This adds a deed record to the victim. The id is a unique number (like
a vnum) that identified the deed. The type is made up from the following
flags:
<ol>
<li>
defaults is Neutral, Private</li>

<li>
1 - Secret (the player is unaware of it)</li>

<li>
2 - Public (all players can see it if they look)</li>

<li>
4 - Good (generally considered a good thing to have done)</li>

<li>
8 - Bad (generally considered a bad thing to do)</li>
</ol>
The title is simply a text string used to explain what the deed means.
<br>In addition to simply letting a character review their past achievements,
deeds can also be used for game control, allowing the world to remember
that things have happened and to modify their behaviour accordingly.
<p>Alternatively you can hand out knowledge about magical disciplines:
<b>MPDEED
victim&nbsp; ADD -1 0 &lt;discipline name></b>
<h3>
<a NAME="mpdeed_remove"></a>MPDEED victim REMOVE id</h3>
This removes the deed record for the victim.
<br>It would normally be used when a player atones for something bad they
did or when they use a favour in exchange for something good they did.
<h3>
<a NAME="mpecho"></a>MPECHO <i>scope</i> text</h3>
This issues the text string as an echo event to all rooms within the named
scope. If a scope is not named, it defaults to the current room.
<p>Valid scopes are:
<dl>
<dt>
_room</dt>

<dd>
The room the mobile is in. This is the default.</dd>

<dt>
_room_plus</dt>

<dd>
This room the mobile is in plus all potentially adjacent rooms.</dd>

<dt>
_subarea</dt>

<dd>
All rooms in the same subarea as the mobile.</dd>

<dt>
_subarea_plus</dt>

<dd>
All room in the same subarea as the mobile plus all potentially adjacent
rooms.</dd>

<dt>
_area</dt>

<dd>
All rooms in the same area as the mobile. This is fairly expensive to process.</dd>

<dt>
_area_plus</dt>

<dd>
All rooms in the same area as the mobile plus all potentially adjacent
rooms.</dd>

<dt>
_zone</dt>

<dd>
All rooms in the same zone as the mobile. This is very expensive to process.</dd>

<dt>
_universe</dt>

<dd>
All rooms in the mud. This is horrendously expensive to process.</dd>

<dt>
_group</dt>

<dd>
All rooms containg one or more mobs in the same group as the mobile.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>
<a NAME="mpechoat"></a>MPECHOAT victim text</h3>
The text is sent to the victim, regardless of where the victim is.
<p><a NAME="mpeffect"></a><b><font size=+1>MPEFFECT</font></b>
<p>This instantaneously applies a spell effect to a mobile without going
through the whole spell casting sequence.&nbsp; It is intended for usage
by high level mobiles granting (or afflicting) others with spell like effects.&nbsp;
Generally mobs should use spell casting instead of this command.&nbsp;
This command will, however, work on an MPAT command.
<p>MPEFFECT mobile 'effect name' level
<p>This applies the named effect to the mobile.&nbsp; This can be the mobile
issueing the MPEFFECT call.&nbsp; If level is omitted, the issuing mobiles
will be used.
<p><a NAME="mpemergency"></a><b><font size=+1>MPEMERGENCY [subarea]</font></b>
<p>This command allows a mob to summon a great number of local guards (if
availiable). This can be very deadly if a criminal flag is given before.
Add a subarea tag for limited range.
<h3>
<a NAME="mpfame"></a>MPFAME victim ammount</h3>
This command rewards FAME points to a player. Never award more than 5 points
and even those only as reward for extraordinary tasks.
<h3>
<a NAME="mpforce"></a>MPFORCE victim command</h3>
This makes the victim (either another mobile or a player) issue the command.
It cannot be used on immortals.
<p>As the command executes, it issues all of its normal messages.
<h3>
<a NAME="mpgoto"></a>MPGOTO vnum</h3>
This moves the mobile to the room corresponding to the given vnum. No messages
are issued.
<p>If the mobile is just moving to an adjacent room, it is better to have
it use the directional movement commands (north, south, east, west, etc...)
as these put out the normal arrival and departure messages.
<p><a NAME="mphunt"></a><b><font size=+1>MPHUNT</font></b>
<p>This makes the mob hunt the specified pc.&nbsp; Currently it only works
with the special routines that handle hunting mobs.
<p>MPHUNT mobile
<br>Mob starts hunting (and trying to kill) the mobile
<p>MPHUNT
<br>Mob stops hunting.
<h3>
<a NAME="mphurt"></a>MPHURT victim d_h s_h d_m s_m d_v s_v</h3>
This causes damage to victim without starting a fight. It is meant to be
used to simulate physical damage due to falling, flying rocks and strange
magical effects. The parameters are pairs of dice number and dice side
values which are rolled and applied to hit points, mana and move.
<p>Because the damage may be fatal, the mob should echo a command describing
the cause of the damage before issuing this command. That way the player
knows what they died of. Not that heavy movement loss may also prove fatal
if the character is in a hostile enviornment.
<h3>
<a NAME="mpinvasion"></a>MPINVASION</h3>
This command schedules an invasion in the area, the mob is currently in.
The invasion will be executed on next area repop..
<h3>
<a NAME="mpjunk"></a>MPJUNK object</h3>
This locates the object within the mobiles inventory and destroys it.
<h3>
<a NAME="mpkill"></a>MPKILL victim</h3>
This causes the mobile to immedietly attack the vitim. It should be used
inplace of the normal kill and murder commands that players use, as it
does not have the checks that prevent players from killing each other.
<p><a NAME="mpmemory"></a><b><font size=+1>MPMEMORY</font></b>
<p>This updates a mobs memory
<p>MPMEMORY mobile REMEMBER slot text
<br>This causes the mob to remember something in a slot.
<p>MPMEMORY mobile FORGET slot
<br>This causes the mobile to forget what is in a slot.
<h3>
<a NAME="mpmload"></a>MPMLOAD vnum</h3>
An instance of the mob identified by vnum is created and placed in the
same room as the mobile. No messages are issued.
<br>If the mob subsequently purges itself, it can present the appearance
of having transformed into something else.
<h3>
<a NAME="mpmset"></a>MPMSET victim stat value</h3>
Similar to the <b>set char</b> wiz-command you can set the stats of a certain
mob.
<h3>
<a NAME="mpnote"></a>MPNOTE &lt;board name> '&lt;recipient>' '&lt;subject>'
&lt;text></h3>
This creates a note written by the mob who executes it. The quotes around
recipient and subject are nescessary, if they are multiple-word strings.
The text itself does not need quotes, but keep it as short as possible.
Substitution parameters as @ax, @vx, @ox can be used anywhere in the command.
<h3>
<a NAME="mpoload"></a>MPOLOAD vnum level</h3>
An instance of the object identified by vnum is loaded at the indicated
level and put into the mobiles inventory. This is true even if the item
cannot, normally, be picked up. This is to allow mobiles to distribute
static objects through out the mud.
<h3>
<a NAME="mposet"></a>MPOSET object stat value</h3>
Similar to the <b>set obj</b> wiz-command you can set the stats of a certain
obj.
<h3>
<a NAME="mppassport"></a>MPPASSPORT player command value</h3>
<font size=+0>This looks for a player's passport and modifies the entries.</font>
<br><font size=+0>COMMAND <b>ADD</b>: The value is the code number of the
crime to add (1-3 at the moment).</font>
<br><font size=+0>COMMAND <b>REMOVE</b>: -1 remove all entries, 0 remove
first entry, 1-999 remove entry of the selected type</font>
<h3>
<a NAME="mppay"></a>MPPAY player money</h3>
<font size=+0>Forces the player to pay some money to the mob. If the amount
is negative, the mob pays. If there isn't enough money (local currency),
as much as possible is given.</font>
<h3>
<a NAME="mppeace"></a>MPPEACE [player]</h3>
<font size=+0>This interrupts a combat if one of the fighting characters
is selected. If nobody is selected all fighting is stopped.</font>
<h3>
<a NAME="mppet"></a>MPPET player</h3>
<font size=+0>This command forces the mob to accept a given player as master.</font>
<h3>
<a NAME="mppktimer"></a>MPPKTIMER player [+, -] time</h3>
<font size=+0>This command sets a players PK timer. The options + or -
allow to add to, substract from an existing timer. Without option the timer
is being set to whatever time is given.</font>
<h3>
<a NAME="mppurge"></a>MPPURGE <i>target</i></h3>
This locates target within the same room as the mobile and destroys it.
Target can be the name of either an object or a mobile. If target is not
specified, then all objects and NPCs in the room (hopefully except pets)
will be destroyed.
<p>Mobiles can use the MPPURGE command on themselves, but it should be
coded as the very last line in the script. In this case, the target can
be specified as 'self'.
<h3>
<a NAME="mpquest"></a>MPQUEST</h3>
MPQUEST player START id title
<br>This starts the player onthe quest and should normally be followed
by an update to give them thier first instruction.
<p>MPQUEST player UPDATE id state instruction
<br>This updates the state of a quest that the player is already on.&nbsp;
There are no checks, so it might move them backwards overall.
<p>MPQUEST player COMPLETE id instruction
<br>This marks the quest as having been completed (state 9999).
<p>MPQUEST player FORGET id
<br>This removes all memory of the quest from the player.&nbsp; It is as
if they had never started it.
<p>If the player is in a group, the command will affect all group members.
<h3>
<a NAME="mprelev"></a>MPRELEV <i>level</i> <i>delta</i></h3>
This mob command allows a mobile to change its level.
<p>Base and delta are added together to work out the level the mob changes
to.
<p>This enables mobs to change their challange factor in response to both
players and actions.
<p>The mob should be created at the lowest level it is likely to want to
achieve, as that is the level its equipment will be created at.
<p>Random level variation still occurs. This modifies the resultant level
by up to 1 level for every 10 levels that the mob has. The code fragment
is:
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (mob->level >= 10) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mob->level += dice(1, mob->level/10);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mob->level -= dice(1, mob->level/10);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</pre>
This means a mob that is meant to be 53rd level, could end up anywhere
from
49th to 57th level, but will average around 53rd.
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 49&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 in 25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4%&nbsp;&nbsp; 1,5
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 in 25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8%&nbsp;&nbsp; 1,4 2,5
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 51&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3 in 25&nbsp;&nbsp; 12%&nbsp;&nbsp; 1,3 2,4 3,5
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 52&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4 in 25&nbsp;&nbsp; 16%&nbsp;&nbsp; 1,2 2,3 3,4 4,5
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 53&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5 in 25&nbsp;&nbsp; 20%&nbsp;&nbsp; 1,1 2,2 3,3 4,4 5,5
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 54&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4 in 25&nbsp;&nbsp; 16%&nbsp;&nbsp; 2,1 3,2 4,3 5,4
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 55&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3 in 25&nbsp;&nbsp; 12%&nbsp;&nbsp; 3,1 4,2 5,3
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 56&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 in 25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8%&nbsp;&nbsp; 4,1 5,2
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 57&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 in 25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4%&nbsp;&nbsp; 5,1</pre>
The primary aim of random level variation is to make areas somewhat less
predictable. What a player can kill one day they may not be able to kill
the next.
<p>Changing a mobs level alters its hit points, mana points, movement points
and armor class. Damage ratios are preserved, however, so if a 20th level
mob with 400 maximum hits and 300 current hits is changed to 10th level
where it rolls 160 maximum hits, its current hits will be reduced to 120.
<h3>
<a NAME="mpreset"></a>MPRESET [room/subarea/area]</h3>
This resets the rooms in a certain range around the mob.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
<a NAME="mpreward"></a>MPREWARD victim [type] ammount</h3>
This gives the victim the specified ammount of xps. Normally it would be
used in response to the player having done something helpful for the mob.
If the victim is the member of a group, the xps are split between all group
members who are present.
<br>Rewards for small actions should be around 1/10th of a level, while
rewards for major achievements should be around a whole level.
<p>Alternative types: xp, fame, prac, train
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="mpsanity"></a><b><font size=+1>MPSANITY</font></b>
<p>MPSANITY player CHECK threshold action
<br>The player makes a sanity check againt the threshold.&nbsp; If an action
has been specified they will take it if they fail the check.&nbsp; If no
action has been specified, they will take a random action.&nbsp; The threshold
must
<br>&nbsp;be at least 30.
<p>MPSANITY player RECOVER points
<br>The players sanity will be increased by the specified number of points.
There is a maximum of 20.
<h3>
<a NAME="mpscript_run"></a>MPSCRIPT victim RUN script_id</h3>
The mobile will enqueue the commands in the indicated script for execution.
<p>This is normally used with a target of self, but if used on others,
the sript comes from the mob issuing the commands, not from the victim.
Used in this fashion, it is an extended version of MPFORCE.
<h3>
<a NAME="mpscript_cancel"></a>MPSCRIPT victim CANCEL cmd_id</h3>
This causes the mobile to dequeue all commands associated with cmd_id that
have not yet been issued.
<h3>
<a NAME="mpselect"></a>MPSELECT mob_sel mob_sel obj_sel obj_sel number
text</h3>
The purpose of this command is to generate an event, containing one or
more elements from the mobs current environment that is then run throug
the mobs triggers to see if any action is required. It provides a very
crude mechanism for a mob to 'think' about its current situation.
<p>mob_sel - a mob selector:
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mob_none&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No mob is selected.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mob_me&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The mob issuing the MPSELECT is selected.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mob_any&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any mob in the room is selected.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mob_npc&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any non player mob in the room is selected.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mob_pc&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any player mob in the room is selected.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mob_pc_mortal&nbsp; Any player mob in the room who is not a god.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; name&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The mob with this name is selected, as long as
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it is neither the selecting mob nor the actor.</pre>
Additionally a selection modifier may be used:
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; random&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One is picked at random
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; highest&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The highest level one is picked
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lowest&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The lowest level one is picked</pre>
For example:
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; highest.mob_pc_mortal</pre>
Will pick the highest level non-god player mob in the room.
<p>The first selector is for the actor, the second is for the victim. The
mob driving the MPSELECT can only be selected through the mob_me selector.
The same mob will not be selected as both actor and victim.
<p>obj_sel - an object selector:
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; obj_none&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No object selected.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; obj_any&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any object in the room can be selected.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; obj_any_actor&nbsp;&nbsp; Any object the actor is carrying/wearing.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; obj_any_victim&nbsp; Any object the victim is carrying/wearing.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; obj_any_mine&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any object the mob is carrying/wearing.</pre>
The first selector is for the primary object, the second for the secondary
object. The same object will not be selected as both primary and secondary.
<p>number - a number, taken as is.
<p>text - taken as is.
<p>Once the various bits have been selected an event (mob, select) is generated
and passed to the mob that issued the MPSELECT command. That is the only
mob that gets to see the event.
<h3>
<a NAME="mpstate"></a>MPSTATE victim state_type state</h3>
A certain state of (or concerning) the victim is changed.
<br>Availiable state_types are:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>MPSTATE player
CONV conversation sub_conv starte</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<b>MPSTATE mob CHAT state</b>
<h3>
<a NAME="mpstop"></a>MPSTOP victim action</h3>
This command just outputs an event with suitable wording to say that the
mobile stopped the victim from taking an action. The messages produced
are:
<pre>&nbsp; mobile STOPS YOU FROM action
&nbsp; mobile STOPS victim FROM action
&nbsp; YOU STOP victim FROM action</pre>
It is designed to the used on a script triggered by a <a href="trigger.html">challange
trigger</a> to explain when the action failed.
<p><a NAME="mpsteal"></a><b><font size=+1>MPSTEAL</font></b>
<p>Allows a mob to unconditionally take an object from another player or
mobile.&nbsp; No messages are generated, so use appropriate echos.
<p>MPSTEAL 'mobile' 'item name'
<br>If item can be found on mobile it will be removed (and unequipped if
worn) and put into the inventory of the mobile.
<h3>
<a NAME="mptransfer"></a>MPTRANSFER victim <i>vnum</i></h3>
This enables the mobile to move other mobiles (including players) to other
rooms. No messages are created during transit and there is no autolook
at the other end.
<p>The victim specifies the name of the mobile to be transported, and a
value of 'all' means all mobiles in the same room as the issuer. They are
moved to the room corresponding to the vnum. If this is omitted, then it
defaults to the room the mobile is in. Note that the victim does not have
to be in the same room as the mobile to get transferred.
<p>Used with a destination of a different room, it can server to move a
player away from the mobile. When used without a vnum, it can serve to
move a player to the mobile (indeed, MPTRANSFER ALL should have the effect
of bringing every player to the mobiles room).
