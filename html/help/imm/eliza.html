<p>There are several "operators" available:
<br>&nbsp; pattern matching:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
or
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ~&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
and-not
<br>&nbsp; special pattern matching:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ^&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
match start
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
exact match
<br>&nbsp; pass 1 scan operators:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
remark
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
output to stderr
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; '&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
output to stdout
<br>&nbsp; response operators:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1-9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
weights are the numerals.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; %&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
include the rest of the response.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Some special notes:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #,',",weights, and the first
( must be in column one.
<p>Syntax of a simple pattern match:
<p>( A | B &amp; C ~ ( D | E | F))
<p>The above would mean if A or B and C and-not D or E or F was in the
<br>sentence then pick one of the responses.
<p>The responses take on the form:
<p>9this is most likely
<br>4somewhat likely
<br>1least likely
<p>However, when a response is triggered, its weight is decreased by one.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Since the above makes little sense, an example will illustrate the use
of
<br>Chat databases better.
<p>#!/usr/bin/chat
<br>#change the above line if the chat executable is in a different place.
<br>#an example of a "Chat" database
<br>"this will be printed to stderr
<br>'this will be printed to stdout
<p>(apple &amp; ( orange | lemon ) ~ pine cones)
<br>9You must have a citrus fruit and an apple.
<br>3you do not have a pine cone but you have an apple.
<br>2what was % suppose to mean?
<p>(=your sentence matches this one exactly)
<br>2you are unimaginative.
<br>9you lack imagination.
