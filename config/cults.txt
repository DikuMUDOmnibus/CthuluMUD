CULT 'Dagon'
This cult is found around the ocean edges and follows the dieties of
the Deep Ones - Dagon and Hydra.  They will quite often interact with
Deep Ones - mainly at rituals where unsavory  acts of worship are 
performed.  The cult is one of the main breeding ground for the hideous
human/deep one halfbreeds.  Members of the cult often have strange 
pieces of Deep Ones jewellery in their posesison.
