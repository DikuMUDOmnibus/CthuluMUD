Attired all in black, the Necromancer is tall and gangly, but still quite
an imposing figure.  A dark cowl shrouds most of his face, but two blazing
embers which serve as eyes can be seen through the shadow.
The Necromancer shrieks some obscenities and orders his minions to attack.

Entrance to the Shadow Grove~
Before you, the grove of shadows lies. Giant grey trees are all that
can be seen through the thick shadows. A great sense of both power and
menace permeates the surrounding area. You have a strange urge to turn
back and go back the way you've come.
  A small path leads north into the shadows and back south to the road.

the further you go.

The End of the Hallway~
You are at the end of a long dark hallway. The darkness here is almost
tangible in its thickness. A deep sense of fear and loathing comes over
you.
  A pair of obsidian doors can be seen to the east.

The chamber of darkness~
You are in a vast chamber. The walls fade into darkness, leaving you
with a very vague idea of the actual size of the room. Swirling here and
there in the dark, are patches of pure black which seem to suck in your
light and leave it that much darker here.

Torture Chamber~
You are in an ill lit chamber. Instruments of torture hang from a rack
on the wall, they seem to quiver with anticipation of a victim as if they
had a mind of their own. An operating table is here, though it is bare.
  An extreme feeling of evil permeates the entire area.

The inner chamber~
You are in a small dark chamber. Upon the walls are glowing sigils of
dark power, scrawled and traced in an evil language no longer known to most
of this plane of existence. There is an obsidian altar here which seems to
glow, but does not shed any light, in fact it seems to be taking light in.

A bright hallway~
You are in a long well lit hallway leading east and west. The walls here
are a milky white color, and glow with a warm luminescence, as does the
floor. A feeling of goodness permeates the area, and you feel unworthy to

The chamber of the white light~
You are in a vast chamber, its walls floor and ceiling are of an unknown
metallic material, the brightest white, almost blindingly stark. A flickering
flame is in the center of the room, seeming to feed off of darkness and
cleansing the room of any evil. You feel a slight tug at your being as the
flame flickers towards you.

The audience chamber~
You are in a large chamber. Small bolts of energy leap from wall to wall,
crackling with power. The floor is a swirl of indeterminable colors and
patterns ever changing. Bright bursts of color seem to explode into the air
and fade again at random times. All this splendor plays about and draws
attention to a large throne in the center of the room, it seems to be cut
from a single enormous emerald.
