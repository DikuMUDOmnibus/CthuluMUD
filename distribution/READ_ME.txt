This distribution contains areas which clearly fall under the
license terms of ROM Mud. This means you cannot use this distribution
if you don't agree to it.

Chat (which has been included as internal part of the code) is
property of Chris Busch and uses the GPL license for distribution. 

The FTP handling package (CURL) which is included, uses the MP
License. If you don't want to use  the Mud-partner system, you can
remove it.

In simple terms this means, if you want to run this as it is, all
licenses shipped apply.
